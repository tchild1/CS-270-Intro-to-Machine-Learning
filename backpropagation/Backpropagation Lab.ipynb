Early stopping, when used correctly, can help avoid overfit by stopping the model when the validation score has not improved by a certain amount in n_iter_no_change. By stopping the model at this point, we prevent the model from training too intensely on the training data when it is not sufficiently improving. Early stopping ensures that when the model isn't improving, it ends so that the model better generalizes to unseen data.  \n",

Looking at the graph \"Validaion Score vs. Epoch\" you can see that there is a huge improvement around epoch number 9, then, 50 iterations later, after this improvement has not been repeated, the model ends. This shows that early_stopping is acting as expected.  \n",

I decided to use averages because it is difficult to determine which alpha value provides the best results from a single run. With all runs completed and averaged, it looks like I got the best results when alpha equals 0.0001. Interestingly, this is also the default value for alpha, which I guess makes sense, that is probably why it was chosen as the default.\n",

That being said however, my accuracy with loss regularization is better and my number of iterations is the same. Futher, when comparing these results to the results I obtained with early stopping, you notive there are several differences. First, as expected the number of epochs are significantly higher with loss regularization than with early stopping. Where early stopping had an average number of epoch of 73.2, with loss regularization the average numer of epochs was about 250. This makes sense because loss regularization doesn't limit the number of epochs, instead it focuses on minimizing loss.  \n",

        "\n",
        "In this process I also learned about the significance of alpha and the best loss value. Alpha is a constant which the penalty function is multiplied by. A low alpha value will punish error less harshly, but potentially allow overfitting because the weights are not being regularized. On the other hand too large of an alpha value can lead to underfitting becuase weights are punished heavily when error occurs and weights are made more even.\n"
